npm install -- to install all dependencies

Currently using Mysql server.\
You will need to set up mysql database prior to seeding the file.

Two ways of accessing the database to generate new table:\
first: you can create your own .env file and replace example string with your actual mysql information.\
sencond: you can replace it directly wihtin database.js.

Seedfile - Can mostly work if you use running shoes.

The function to seed data is currently commented out.\
Please pick what type of data you would like to seed into your db.\
Mix and match are recommended.\
npm run seed to upload fakeData.

my code will randomly sort get request data & grabs the first 50.
